WorldEditCUI
------------

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/Funboyy/WorldEditCUI/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Funboyy/WorldEditCUI/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A graphical user interface for [WorldEdit]. WorldEditCUI is designed
to assist in using WorldEdit, as well as preventing accidental errors.

Please note that this is not [WorldEdit], which allows you to make changes
to your world, but WorldEditCUI, a frontend for WorldEdit. You must have
WorldEdit installed on your server.

This version is modified to create a LabyMod Addon (fork of [WorldEditCUI](https://github.com/EngineHub/WorldEditCUI)).
